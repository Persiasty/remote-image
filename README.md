This project was created to make easier sharing images and characters posters by game master to players during RPG session.
Requirements: 2 computers (the best option is laptop and surface pro tablet)

Concept:
+ Server is running on surface which players see
+ Client is running on GM laptop
+ devices should be connected to the same local network
+ in server application run *Broadcast IP* option and on client find it via discover option (select address and click ok)
+ GM can now drop image file (or even image from browser) on client aplication and then players will see it on server app
